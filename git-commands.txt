## **Basic Concepts First**
- **Repository (repo)**: A folder tracked by Git containing your project
- **Commit**: A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time
- **Branch**: A separate line of development (like a parallel version of your project)
- **Remote**: A version of your repository hosted online (like on GitHub)

---

## **Setup & Configuration**

**`git config`** - Set up your Git settings
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

**`git init`** - Create a new Git repository in your current folder
```bash
git init
```
This creates a hidden `.git` folder that tracks everything.

---

## **Getting Information**

**`git status`** - Show what's changed in your project
```bash
git status
```
Shows: files that are modified, staged for commit, or untracked (new files Git doesn't know about yet).

**`git log`** - Show history of commits
```bash
git log
```
Shows who made changes, when, and their commit messages.

**`git diff`** - Show exact changes in your files
```bash
git diff
```
Shows line-by-line what you've changed but haven't staged yet.

**`git branch`** - List all branches or show current branch
```bash
git branch          # List all branches
git branch -a       # List all branches including remote ones
```

---

## **Making Changes**

**`git add`** - Stage files for commit (prepare them to be saved)
```bash
git add index.html       # Stage one file
git add .                # Stage all changed files
git add *.css            # Stage all CSS files
```
Think of this as putting items in a shopping cart before checkout.

**`git commit`** - Save your staged changes with a message
```bash
git commit -m "Add homepage"
```
This creates a permanent snapshot. The `-m` flag adds a message describing what you changed.

**`git commit -am`** - Stage and commit in one step (only for already tracked files)
```bash
git commit -am "Update styling"
```

---

## **Branching**

**`git branch <name>`** - Create a new branch
```bash
git branch feature-navbar
```
Branches let you work on new features without affecting your main code.

**`git checkout`** - Switch to a different branch
```bash
git checkout feature-navbar
```

**`git checkout -b <name>`** - Create and switch to a new branch
```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
```

**`git branch -M <name>`** - Rename current branch
```bash
git branch -M main
```
Commonly used to rename "master" to "main".

**`git branch -d <name>`** - Delete a branch
```bash
git branch -d old-feature
```

**`git merge`** - Combine another branch into your current branch
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-navbar
```
This brings changes from `feature-navbar` into `main`.

---

## **Working with Remote Repositories (GitHub)**

**`git remote`** - Manage connections to remote repositories
```bash
git remote -v                                    # List all remotes
git remote add origin https://github.com/...    # Connect to GitHub
git remote remove origin                         # Remove connection
```

**`git clone`** - Download a repository from GitHub to your computer
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
```
This copies the entire project to your machine.

**`git push`** - Upload your commits to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main              # Push to main branch
git push -u origin main           # Push and set as default
git push                          # Push to default remote/branch
```
The `-u` flag sets the upstream, so next time you can just type `git push`.

**`git pull`** - Download changes from GitHub and merge them
```bash
git pull origin main
```
This does two things: `git fetch` (download) + `git merge` (combine).

**`git fetch`** - Download changes from GitHub without merging
```bash
git fetch origin
```
Good for seeing what's changed before merging.

---

## **Undoing Changes**

**`git restore`** - Discard changes in a file (newer Git versions)
```bash
git restore index.html           # Undo changes to file
git restore --staged index.html  # Unstage a file
```

**`git reset`** - Unstage files or undo commits
```bash
git reset index.html             # Unstage a file
git reset HEAD~1                 # Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1          # Undo last commit (DELETE changes)
```
⚠️ Be careful with `--hard` - it permanently deletes your work!

**`git revert`** - Undo a commit by creating a new commit
```bash
git revert abc123
```
Safer than reset because it doesn't delete history.

---

## **Advanced/Useful Commands**

**`git stash`** - Temporarily save changes without committing
```bash
git stash                 # Save current changes
git stash pop             # Restore saved changes
git stash list            # See all stashes
```
Useful when you need to switch branches but aren't ready to commit.

**`git tag`** - Mark specific commits (like version numbers)
```bash
git tag v1.0
git push origin v1.0
```

**`git rm`** - Remove files from Git tracking
```bash
git rm oldfile.html
```

**`git mv`** - Rename or move files
```bash
git mv old.html new.html
```

---

## **Typical Workflow**

Here's how these commands work together in practice:

```bash
# 1. Start a new project
git init

# 2. Make changes to files
# (edit index.html in your editor)

# 3. Check what changed
git status

# 4. Stage your changes
git add index.html

# 5. Commit with a message
git commit -m "Add homepage content"

# 6. Connect to GitHub (first time only)
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git

# 7. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# Later, when making more changes:
git add .
git commit -m "Update styling"
git push
```

Does this help clarify things? Any specific commands you want me to explain in more detail?
